# Second-Repo-Experiment

This was quite a learning experience. Firstly had to learn how to properly use Git and Github in order to add all the required files, did so by watching some youtuube videos and help of AI.
I then went onto creating the .py file where we had to use Beautiful soup to do some webscraping. Was a bit tricky at first, i nearly gave up. But I eventually got the hang of it and was able to scrape information from a weather website, I scraped todays weather. I learned that web scraping is quite an easy thing to do once you know how to. Using the 'find_all' method i was able to get the high and low temperature of today. 
A good learning experience!
